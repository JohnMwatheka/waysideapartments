          <h2>Diani Beach – Kenya </h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
             <b>Diani Beach</b> is a major beach resort on the Indian Ocean coast of Kenya. <b>Diani Beach</b> is located 30 kilometers south of <b>Mombasa</b>, in the nearby <b>Kwale County</b> – Diani popularity with tourists has rendered the area an ever-growing assortment of beach hotels, Apartments hostels, bars and Diani restaurants. Yet, it’s privacy and seclusion are maintained, making it the perfect beach escape. Diani Beach is a 10 km stretch of fine, white, glistening sand surrounded by azure waters. Diani Beach is one of the most captivating places you will ever visit, when tides are shallow reefs reveal an exquisite world of sea life right at your feet. Scurrying crabs retreat to their hiding places as you wade through the crystalline waters. The lush rainforest at its fringes only adds to the picture-postcard atmosphere. Sea salt lingers in the air; fresh coconuts reappear in your hands and time truly appears frozen. Diani Beach is deservedly one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, as one of Kenya's most popular holiday destinations, in addition, various activities are offered: From camel riding to diving on the coral reefs, drinking a fresh coconut on the beach to sipping cocktails at a beach bar: <b>Diani Beach</b> leaves no wish unfulfilled, because the infrastructure and the service on the beach make a relaxed, carefree stay possible for you. <b>Mombasa Airport</b> is about 42 km north of the beach. It is the second most important airport in Kenya and is served by various international airlines. Almost all beach travelers arrive at this airport in Kenya. It is advisable to withdraw money directly at the airport and buy a Kenyan SIM card, if necessary, the <b>hotels in Diani Beach</b> usually offer a pick-up service from the airport. If not, a taxi can be taken. As everywhere in Kenya, it is important to negotiate the price of the taxi ride before boarding. Some taxi drivers have a price table in the car, which was made by the hotels. This prevents excessive prices from being demanded. A taxi ride from Mombasa airport to Diani Beach cost between 60 and 80 euros, as in the rest of Kenya, some Tuktuks and Boda-Bodas also drive along Diani Beach Road. The three-wheeled vehicles with seating cabin, Tuktuk, and the motorcycle taxi, Boda-Boda, are considerably cheaper than a normal taxi. This also saves comfort. The price must be negotiated in advance. Along the Diani beach there are various possibilities to buy small souvenirs and souvenirs. At the stands there are fine cloths and wooden animal figures, bracelets, chains and cooking utensils. A name can be carved into some wooden objects, if you bring some waiting time. The payment of a partial amount in advance is completely normal, here there is no reason to become suspicious. On Diani Beach Road, right behind the beach and the beach hotels, there are various shopping facilities for food, clothing and electronics. The three large shopping centers are on site: The <b>Diani Beach Shopping Center</b>, the Baharini Shopping Center and the Nakumatt Shopping Center. In the shopping centres there are Western-style supermarkets, souvenir shops and shops where clothes can be bought. Photography is usually not permitted there. If high-quality electronic products such as batteries for the camera, chargers, etc. are required, a trip to Mombasa is indispensable. The <b>restaurants in Diani Beach</b> are touristic and influenced by the West. Here you will find perhaps the best restaurants for tourists on the entire Kenyan coast. Of particular interest is the "<b>Ali Barbour's Cave Restaurant</b>" - a restaurant which, as the name suggests, is located in a cave. The restaurant "The Sands at Nomad" also has a great location directly on the beach. There are various national and international dishes, from pizza and rice dishes to fish and seafood. A little smaller, but also recommended, is the "Lymington Bistro", which is also located on the beach. Delicious and good pasta and pizza are available in the pizzeria "Aniellos Pizzeria". The pizzeria is popular with tourists and is located directly on <b>Diani Beach Road</b>. Most tourists stay at in apartments during their stay. But the area around Diani Beach has many good bars that make a trip worthwhile. The "<b>Nomads Beach Bar</b>" offers various cocktail specialties.

The length and width of the beach will save you from a sardine can experience, but it's not really authentic here. Nevertheless: <b>Diani Beach</b> is a celebrity and rightly so we can recommend a visit to this beach beauty with all our hearts. In front of Diani Beach there are 18 coral reefs. Boats leave at high tide so that you can dive there. The colorful reefs are definitely worth a dive. With a bit of luck, you can also see sea turtles, dolphins, rays, whale sharks, seahorses and knight fish. The best time to see this is between October and April. At low tide you can walk on the bottom of the sea. You can see starfish, sea cucumbers, sea spiders and crabs. Sea urchins, smaller moray eels and the dangerous stonefish can also be observed. Bathing shoes are an absolute must due to the highly poisonous stonefish! Depending on the season you can also see kitesurfers and windsurfers on the beach. The strongest wind blows between December and February. Some providers, such as Galu Kinondo Beach, give surf lessons or rent equipment for stand-up paddling. In the south Diani Beach borders onalu Kinondo Beach and in the north on <b>Tiwi Beach</b>. Compared to the other two beaches, Diani Beach is hardly to surpass in beauty. White sandy beach, clear water and a great backdrop of palm trees, greenery and beach bars make the beach perfect. This beauty is preserved by nature conservation and the <b>Diani Chale Marine Reserve</b>. The warm water of the Indian Ocean with a temperature around 30°C takes a little getting used to. Accessing Diani Beach requires a ferry trip from <b>Mombasa</b>, via the <b>Likoni Ferry</b>, followed by a drive of around 40 minutes. The ferry ride itself does not take more than 10 minutes; however, the queue to get on is unpredictable, meaning you could have to wait in line for up to an hour, From Mombasa, get off the ferry and continue straight down the South Coast Road until you reach Ukunda. As you drive into Ukunda turn left onto the Diani Beach link road, it is well sign posted and Matatus all over the place. After 3km you will arrive at a ‘T’ junction, turn right drive for about 1km and you will see the Diani Beach Shopping Centre on your right-hand side – It is well sign posted so you shouldn’t have too many difficulties.

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Getting to Diani Beach is simple. The Diani Beach can be reached by air, car, and bus.
          <b>By Air:</b> If your next holiday destination is Diani and you are wondering how to get there, the most convenient & fastest way would be to <b>fly directly to Diani</b>. If you do opt to fly, then you have two options either flying from Nairobi’s Wilson airport or Jomo Kenyatta International Airport or from Moi International Airport in Mombasa. Several flights connect Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Ukunda (<b>Diani Airport</b>) on a regular basis. Additionally, there are flights available from Nairobi Wilson Airport to Ukunda Airport on a regular basis. Several local airlines operate flights to Diani Beach at Wilson airport and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and therefore you can arrive and book the next flight at your convenience. The <b>flight from Nairobi to Diani Ukunda</b> airstrip takes approximately 45 minutes. On the other hand, if you book your flight from Moi International airport to Diani Beach it will take less than 15 minutes to touch down at <b>Ukunda airstrip</b> from where you can transfer to your beach hotel. The most popular flights operational to and from Diani at the Ukunda Airstrip include: Jambo jet: Flies every day from JKIA <b>Nairobi – Diani Ukunda Airstrip</b> within the following times; 1010hrs and 1510hrs and a return flight to JKIA at 1115hrs and 1655hrs. <b>Safari link:</b> operates <b>daily flights Nairobi to Diani</b> at 1400hrs then from Diani to Vipingo at 1535hrs and lastly from Vipingo to Wilson at 1410hrs.

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Diani Beach is generally a safe coastal area in Kenya. However, it is not advisable to walk alone at night, regardless of your gender.

There have been occasional reports of tourists being mugged in isolated parts of the beach. Additionally, unless you are familiar with the locale, you could easily get lost. That said, the area within and around hotels or resorts usually has security personnel, but it's always best to take precautions and not venture out alone during the night.
